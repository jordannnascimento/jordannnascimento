# Hi, I'm Jordann 👋  

I'm a Graphic Designer expanding my skill set with programming,  
not to transition careers — but to become a more complete, modern and versatile designer.

I believe the future of design blends:  
🎨 Creativity  
💻 Technology  
🧠 Logical thinking  
📊 Data and user understanding  

So I'm actively learning Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build better, more interactive, and more strategic design solutions.

## 🚀 What I'm currently developing

- Enhancing my ability to collaborate with developers  
- Understanding how interfaces, logic and code work behind the scenes  
- Creating small web experiments to improve my problem-solving  
- Bringing design + tech together in a practical way

## 🎮 Featured Project  
### Mystery Word Game  

A mini word-guessing game originally built in Python and later adapted into a browser version using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
A tribute to Linkin Park — a band that inspires both my creativity and my personal journey.
